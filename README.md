This assignment was to make some adjustments to the code of an already existed website. I updated the title of the website to Horiseon, gave alt ids to all of the img's on the page. Gave new semantics of main to enclose the sections of the page. Also gave labeling to the aside elements on the page to make it more clear to anyone else looking at the code what the layout should be like. An id was missing for the search enigine opitimaztion nav link it is now corrected and functioning proprely. Also went in and cleaned up some of the CSS elements to consolidate the amount of code written.![Screenshot 2021-11-13 155102](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93616520/141700324-40d12936-6988-494c-9bf3-bafc48d58271.png)
